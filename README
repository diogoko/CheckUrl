CheckUrl is a simple application to check the status of web sites. It periodically sends requests to a URL and shows the response in a tray icon (and in a balloon if the request was not successful).

Upon start, an icon is added to the tray. By right clicking it, a short menu is opened with the options "Check now" (to check the URL immediately) and "Exit" (to close the application).

CheckUrl is meant to be configured through the command line or with arguments added to a shortcut. The following arguments are accepted:

  CheckUrl.jar [-interval MINUTES_BETWEEN_CHECK] URL

If no interval is specified, only manual checks are available (using the "Check now" menu option).
